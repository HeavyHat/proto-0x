Proto-0x: A Reimagined EDSL Toolkit for C++-11
==============================================

This project aims to reimplement and redesign [Boost.Proto](http://boost.org/libs/proto) for
C++11. No effort will be made to preserve backwards compatibility with the C++98 version.

This is highly experimental and undocumented code. You would be insane to use it for anything
whatsoever. This code comes with no support.

Pre-requisites
--------------

This library depends on:

* An up-to-date clang built from trunk.
* Boost, also trunk.
